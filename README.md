# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is a collection of implementations of fundamental data structures, popular algorithms, and solutions to practice problems from various platforms, including the DSA sheet by Love Babbar. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others looking to understand and implement these concepts in their own projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

### Algorithm
This section contains implementations of various algorithms, categorized into subdirectories. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific type of algorithm.

- **Sorting**
  - Implementations of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching**
  - Implementations of searching algorithms like Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.
- **etc.**

### Data_Structure
This section contains implementations of fundamental data structures, categorized into subdirectories. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific data structure.

- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **etc.**

### Practice
This section contains solutions to practice problems from various platforms, including the DSA sheet by Love Babbar. Each problem has its own subdirectory, containing the solution and any associated files.

- **Problem1**
  - Description and solution for Problem 1.
- **Problem2**
  - Description and solution for Problem 2.
- More problems will be added as I work through different platforms...

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PTD504/DSA_Practice.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the desired section**:
    ```sh
    cd DSA_Practice/Algorithm/Sorting
    ```

3. **Explore the code**:
    - Each subdirectory contains source code files with implementations of the respective data structures or algorithms.
    - For the Practice section, each problem subdirectory contains the problem statement and solution.
